Protocol Analyzer Viewer
------------------------
Imports analog capture files (such as those from a Saleae Logic Pro 16) and
processes them according to the 'mode' flag.

Running modes:
--decode: treats the capture as a USART (115200 8-N-1 for now) and runs the
samples through a protocol analyzer.  Results will be written to stdout.

--plotpng: plots the capture to a png

--gui: loads the capture into a GUI.
    GUI Keys:
        z / x - zoom in/out
        left / right - find previous/next digital edge.
        q - quit

* Note: If no input capture is specified, it'll try to load a demo from where
* the Debian packager installed it.
